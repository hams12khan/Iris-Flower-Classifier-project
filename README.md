# Iris-Flower-Classifier-project

This is a minor or we can say that it is a beginner project for data science student.
In this i try to create a machine learning model that can predict the Iris Flower name by giving its parameter such as sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width.
Here i use decision tree as a classifier to predict the Iris Flower name.
In this i use iris flower dataset that i import from scikt learn package module.
